# pokemon generator
In this project I built a Variational Convolutional Autoencoder capable of generating pokemon images.
I used a dataset containing more than 800 images, further expanded through data augmentation techniques.
The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset)
